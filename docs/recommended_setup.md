# Recommended Codex setup

These optional user-level instructions and configuration defaults complement the marketplace plugins across all projects. Review and adapt them to your own security requirements, tools, and working style.

## User-level instructions

This repository includes a recommended [user-level AGENTS.md file](../AGENTS_user.md) with global Codex instructions that complement the plugins. Review and adapt it as desired, or directly copy it into your Codex home directory:

```bash
cp AGENTS_user.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md  # <-- CAUTION: Check first whether you have an existing AGENTS.md that might get clobbered!
```

Codex applies `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` as user-level guidance across all your projects. If that file already exists, merge the recommendations into it instead of overwriting your existing instructions.

## User-level configuration

The following generic defaults are a practical starting point for `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
plan_mode_reasoning_effort = "high"

[history]
persistence = "save-all"
max_bytes = 52428800
```

You can additionally opt in to live web search and outbound network access for sandboxed commands. Merge these entries into the appropriate locations rather than duplicating TOML tables; `web_search` is a top-level setting.

```toml
web_search = "live"

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

Command network access allows package managers such as `pip`, `uv`, `npm`, and `cargo` to query registries and download dependencies. Live web search and command network access both increase exposure to untrusted external content, so enable them deliberately.

You can also opt in to pinning a preferred model with the following top-level setting:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
```

Use `/model` within Codex to select an available model and add or update this setting automatically, especially when switching to a newer model.

For Python development, add these writable roots to the same `[sandbox_workspace_write]` table to let `pip` and `uv` reuse their caches and let `uv` manage downloaded tools and Python installations:

```toml
writable_roots = [
  "~/.cache/gh",
  "~/.cache/pip",
  "~/.cache/uv",
  "~/.local/share/uv",
]
```

The following is one possible TUI setup for a detailed status line and informative terminal title:

```toml
[tui]
status_line = ["project-name", "git-branch", "model-with-reasoning", "run-state", "task-progress", "context-used", "total-input-tokens", "total-output-tokens", "five-hour-limit", "weekly-limit", "thread-title", "session-id"]
terminal_title = ["activity", "project-name"]
```

See [Marketplace plugin installation](installation.md) if the `la-review` and `toolkit` plugins are not installed yet. After completing the user-level setup, continue with [Language-agnostic project setup](project_setup_agnostic.md) for each repository and then [Python project setup](project_setup_python.md) when applicable.

# Language-agnostic project setup

This guide covers project documents, editor settings, Git hooks, Codex configuration, and CI. Merge the examples with existing files rather than overwriting them. For Python tooling, also use [Python project setup](project_setup_python.md).

For a new empty repository, use the [New repository setup recipe](https://github.com/pallgeuer/la-dev-codex-plugins/blob/main/docs/new_repo_recipe.md).

## 1. Create the root project documents

Create `README.md` with the headings that apply:

```markdown
# Project name

One sentence stating what the project does and for whom.

## Installation

Exact installation or setup commands.

## Usage

One minimal working example, followed by links to detailed documentation.

## Compatibility

Supported platforms, runtimes, and important exclusions.

## Documentation

Links to user and developer documentation.

## Contributing

Link to CONTRIBUTING.md, when present.

## License

License name and link to the license file.
```

Keep installation and the first example usable without reading the whole file. Omit `Contributing` when the project does not accept contributions. Choose licensing independently of repository visibility. Include the appropriate `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` and attribution when a license is needed, including any requested later-version permission.

For a versioned project, create `CHANGELOG.md` with a Release diffs section:

````markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## Release diffs

TODO: Replace this placeholder with real release/comparison links when preparing the first version tag. No version tags exist yet. The following is an example only; these versions and links do not describe existing releases:

```text
Unreleased: https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/compare/v0.2.0...HEAD
v0.2.0: https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0
v0.1.0: https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/releases/tag/v0.1.0
```

---

## Unreleased

None.
````

Until the first release, keep the comparison examples labeled as examples. Replace them with real links when preparing that release: Unreleased compares the latest tag with HEAD, later versions compare consecutive tags, and the first version links to its release.

Replace `None.` with Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed sections as work lands. Describe shipped outcomes, retain Unreleased when empty, and separate top-level sections with horizontal rules.

For example, a minimal complete changelog with two releases can use level-four category headings within the standard change-type sections:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

```

Replace the repository, versions, dates, categories, and outcomes with the project facts. Preserve the `Unreleased` section even when it is empty.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` is optional. Add it for a shared or open-source repository and include exact environment setup, repository layout, focused and complete checks, documentation commands, dependency policy, and pull-request expectations.

For a versioned project, [create `RELEASE.md` during setup](#9-create-releasemd-for-versioned-projects), even before its first release. The bundled `publish-release` Perform action requires this file and follows it as the project-specific release authority.

## 2. Add development document and scratch locations

Create the durable and temporary locations:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/devel/plans
touch docs/devel/plans/.gitkeep
touch TODO.txt
```

Use `docs/devel/` for committed implementation specifications, audits, and repeatable workflows. Use `docs/devel/plans/` for temporary plans, progress journals, and AI handoff notes. Use root `TODO.txt` only as a private scratchpad; durable work belongs in an issue, test, specification, action, or changelog entry.

## 3. Add a concise `.gitignore`

Start with this block and add only outputs the project actually creates:

```gitignore
.DS_Store
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo
/.codex/toolkit_perform_actions/action_catalogue.md
/docs/devel/plans/*
!/docs/devel/plans/.gitkeep
/TODO.txt
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
```

Then stage the placeholder explicitly:

```bash
git add docs/devel/plans/.gitkeep
```

If the placeholder is ignored, use `git add -f docs/devel/plans/.gitkeep`. Keep `.env.example` free of credentials, and avoid broad image/JSON ignores that could hide source fixtures.

Language-specific caches, environments, and build outputs belong in the corresponding language setup rather than a copied all-purpose ignore template.

## 4. Add repository-level Codex configuration

Create `.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
plan_mode_reasoning_effort = "high"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
web_search = "live"

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
writable_roots = [
  "~/.cache/gh",
  "~/.cache/pre-commit",
]
```

The file records project defaults and enables repository-local Perform actions. Its writable_roots list replaces the user/system list, so include every external cache the project needs. Project configuration loads only for trusted projects; see [Project trust](https://github.com/pallgeuer/la-dev-codex-plugins/blob/main/docs/recommended_setup.md#project-trust). Disable search/network access if your security requirements prohibit it.

## 5. Create a concise `AGENTS.md`

Keep AGENTS.md focused on ongoing development: purpose, layout, commands, and rules. Replace angle-bracketed placeholders with project details; the other template text is reusable as written.

```markdown
# Repository instructions

This repository is for <brief description of the repository's purpose>.

## Project layout

- Keep this project layout in `AGENTS.md` up-to-date as new project structure emerges.
- <List each first-party source, test, documentation, and generated-output root.>
- `docs/devel/plans/` contains ignored temporary plans, journals, and AI handoffs.
- <Identify the supported public interfaces and their sources of truth.>

## Commands

- <Record the exact canonical setup, formatting, linting, type-checking, test, documentation, and full-check commands after those commands exist.>

## Code style

- NEVER manually wrap code/comments/in-code documentation during code writing and edits; allow the formatters to later enforce line length.
- Use ASCII-only project source; represent required non-ASCII values with escapes. Markdown files may use literal non-ASCII when required, but should still make obvious near-equivalent ASCII replacements where suitable.
- Use sentence case for Markdown headings and table headers; capitalize only the first word, the first word after a colon, and proper nouns.

## Tests

- Put stable behavior and important failure modes under automated test; do not lock incidental wording or implementation details unless they are the public contract.
- After changing behavior, run applicable functional tests in addition to formatting, linting, type checking, and compatibility checks.
- Do not lock incidental text into test assertions. If tests fail only because wording changed, determine whether the wording is a public contract and ask when unclear; do not blindly revert the wording.

## Workflows

- Do not change project versions during ordinary development; update them only when the user explicitly requests a version bump or release.
- Interview me for relevant details when making plans, unless the details are quite clear already from the provided information.
- When changing a public interface, update its tests, documentation, examples, and changelog entry in the same change.
- Concisely document significant completed work in CHANGELOG.md under the Unreleased section, using Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed headings, short general level-four category headings, outcome bullets beneath those category headings, and horizontal rules between top-level changelog sections.
- Use a solo direct-main workflow with minimal remote automation. Do not add publication, update bots, branch protection, or a hosted documentation site without a new decision.
```

Keep the template wording unless a project-specific decision requires a change, and adapt the workflow when collaboration needs differ. The ASCII policy is optional for projects that intentionally use Unicode source. Put longer explanations in focused development documents; keep formatter/linter settings in their configuration files.

## 6. Install baseline pre-commit checks

### Establish editor and source-file hygiene

Use these files alongside the hooks below. Preserve existing settings, and review line-ending normalization separately in an existing repository.

Create `.editorconfig`:

```ini
root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[*.{yml,yaml,json}]
indent_size = 2

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

Create `.gitattributes`:

```gitattributes
* text=auto eol=lf
```

Preserve deliberate binary attributes. Keep credentials, environments, and generated output out of Git. Private-key detection catches some secrets, not all of them.

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) using the project environment or an isolated tool runner. Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, replacing `vX.Y.Z` with a released tag of this repository:

```yaml
minimum_pre_commit_version: "4.6.0"
default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, pre-push]

repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v6.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-json
        stages: [pre-commit, pre-push, manual]
      - id: check-toml
        stages: [pre-commit, pre-push, manual]
      - id: check-yaml
        stages: [pre-commit, pre-push, manual]
      - id: check-merge-conflict
        stages: [pre-commit, pre-push, manual]
      - id: detect-private-key
        stages: [pre-commit, pre-push, manual]
      - id: check-added-large-files
        args: [--maxkb=5120, --enforce-all]
        stages: [pre-commit, pre-push, manual]
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
        stages: [pre-commit]
      - id: trailing-whitespace
        args: [--markdown-linebreak-ext=md]
        stages: [pre-commit]

  - repo: https://github.com/pallgeuer/la-dev-codex-plugins
    rev: vX.Y.Z
    hooks:
      - id: markdown-tables-fix
        stages: [pre-commit]
      - id: markdown-tables-check
        stages: [pre-push, manual]
```

Install both hook types and verify the non-mutating stage:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual
```

Every code repository should add an appropriate formatter and linter, and normally tests and type checks, before considering setup complete. Add those hooks in the language-specific guide. Commit-time hooks may fix files; pre-push, manual, and CI hooks should only check.

The large-file hook allows up to 5 MiB (5,242,880 bytes). With `--enforce-all`, it checks every supplied file, including modified files; an all-files run checks all tracked files. Larger files fail the hook without being changed or deleted. For legitimate larger files, adjust the limit, add a narrow exclusion, or use external storage/Git LFS; LFS-filtered paths are skipped by this hook.

Whitespace fixers run only at commit time and preserve Markdown line breaks. Manual, pre-push, and CI checks must not rewrite files.

## 7. Add repeatable Perform actions when needed

When a contextual task recurs, or a project convention cannot be enforced reliably by a standard tool, script, or test, create `.codex/toolkit_perform_actions/actions.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ignore_actions": [],
  "actions": {
    "audit-project-convention": {
      "agnostic": {
        "gloss": "Audit the project-specific convention",
        "model": "default",
        "reasoning_effort": "medium",
        "goal_mode": false,
        "plan_mode": false,
        "plan_reasoning_effort": "medium",
        "no_edits": true,
        "prompt_vars": {},
        "prompt": "Audit the repository against docs/devel/project_convention.md. Produce an enumerated findings list with exact evidence and concrete corrections.",
        "requires_interactive": false,
        "custom_codex_args": [],
        "notes": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Keep actions narrow and make their success verifiable. Prefer automation over an action when the rule can be checked deterministically. See [Codex Perform](https://github.com/pallgeuer/la-dev-codex-plugins/blob/main/docs/codex_perform.md) for variants, variables, overrides, and launch modes.

Generate the effective catalogue after adding or changing actions:

```text
$toolkit:perform update-action-catalogue
```

To generate it directly without spending another Codex turn, source the marketplace checkout's activation script once in each new Bash session and run the standalone catalogue command from the target repository:

```bash
# Locate it when necessary:
find "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}" -path "*/la-dev-codex-plugins/activate.sh"

# Often this is ~/.codex/.tmp/marketplaces/la-dev-codex-plugins/activate.sh.
source /PATH/TO/la-dev-codex-plugins/activate.sh
codex-perform catalogue
```

The script must be sourced, not executed. The default standalone command produces the same repository catalogue as the in-chat action.

The default output, `.codex/toolkit_perform_actions/action_catalogue.md`, is generated and should remain git-ignored.

## 8. Add CI when the repository has a remote

For a Python project, follow [Add Python CI](project_setup_python.md#10-add-python-ci) after completing the Python setup instead of copying the generic installation step below. That workflow recreates the locked development environment, including its pinned pre-commit installation, and runs the same manual-stage checks through `uv`.

CI should run the same non-mutating complete check used locally. For a non-GitHub remote, configure that remote's CI service to run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual
```

### If the project uses a GitHub remote

Create `.github/workflows/checks.yml`:

```yaml
name: Checks

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: ["**"]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - name: Install pre-commit
        run: python3 -m pip install pre-commit==4.6.0
      - name: Run non-mutating checks
        run: pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual --show-diff-on-failure
```

Replace the installation step with the project's locked environment once one exists. Grant extra workflow permissions only to the job that needs them.

## 9. Create `RELEASE.md` for versioned projects

Document the release process in root `RELEASE.md`, including real paths, commands, destinations, and recovery steps. A private project can use manual releases without package-index publication.

Cover these stages:

1. **Sources of truth:** Version file, tag format, changelog, build configuration, and destinations.
2. **Prerequisites:** Branch, clean worktree, tools, credentials, and any deployment permissions.
3. **Version:** Review the complete release diff and confirm the exact next version before editing metadata.
4. **Metadata:** Update versions and comparison links; compact the changelog into accurate user-facing outcomes and review it against the diff.
5. **Validation:** Run locked checks, inspect artifacts, and test independent installations.
6. **Commit and CI:** Push the preparation commit and require its exact CI run to succeed.
7. **Tag:** Create an annotated version tag on that commit; never move a published tag.
8. **Preflight:** Validate the tagged code without publishing.
9. **Publication approval:** Confirm the exact version, tag, commit, notes, artifacts, and destination.
10. **Publication:** Identify the command/event and any manual deployment gate.
11. **Verification:** Check release notes, tag identity, downloadable assets/checksums, and final repository state.
12. **Recovery:** Explain failures before tagging, interrupted uploads, and defective published artifacts.

Run `$toolkit:perform publish-release` to follow the project's runbook. The action asks separately for version and publication approval.

## 10. Optionally add a Zensical documentation site

Skip this section when the repository does not need a published documentation site. A typical layout is:

```text
docs_site/                         # Hand-authored site pages
docs/public/                       # Published specifications
docs/devel/                        # Internal development documents
tools/docs/generate_zensical.py    # Project-specific generator, when Python is used
zensical.template.toml             # Tracked authored configuration
.generated/                        # Git-ignored generated input tree
zensical.generated.toml            # Git-ignored generated configuration
site/                              # Git-ignored built site
```

The generator may be written in Python or any other project-appropriate language and may live at another clearly documented path. Keep authored and generated files separate. Run generation before `zensical build --strict`; do not run them in parallel. Add a GitHub Pages workflow only when the project uses a GitHub remote and wants Pages deployment.

When the project has a generated Zensical input tree, add this conditional instruction to `AGENTS.md` and replace the placeholder with the exact project command:

```markdown
- Do not run `<DOCUMENT-GENERATION-COMMAND>` and `zensical build` in parallel; the build reads the generated tree that the generator refreshes.
```

## 11. Verify the setup

Run the manual pre-commit stage, inspect the complete diff, and check that git-ignored scratch/generated files are not staged:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual
git diff --check
git status --short --ignored
```

Audit the result without edits:

```text
$toolkit:perform audit-project-setup[agnostic]
```

For Python, continue with [Python project setup](project_setup_python.md). Otherwise continue with [AI-supported repository development](https://github.com/pallgeuer/la-dev-codex-plugins/blob/main/docs/ai_supported_development.md).

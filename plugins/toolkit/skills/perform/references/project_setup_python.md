# Python project setup

Complete [Language-agnostic project setup](project_setup_agnostic.md) first. This recipe assumes a modern `src/`-layout project managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); merge it into an existing project rather than replacing working packaging or tool configuration blindly.

Replace every `YOUR_*` placeholder before running the copied configuration. The versions below are a reproducible snapshot based on [pydocformatter](https://github.com/pallgeuer/pydocformatter); research and pin current compatible releases when adopting the recipe.

## 1. Choose the package and compatibility identities

Write down these values before editing configuration (choose the appropriate Python version(s) to support):

```text
Distribution name: YOUR-DISTRIBUTION-NAME
Import package: YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE
Minimum Python: 3.12
Supported Python versions: 3.12 through current
Supported operating systems: YOUR_SUPPORTED_SYSTEMS
CLI command, if any: YOUR-CLI
Version source: src/YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE/_version.py
```

Use the distribution name in package metadata and PyPI URLs; use the import package in Python imports. Do not advertise an interpreter or platform as supported unless the code and direct dependencies are compatible and the claim has proportionate CI or documented best-effort status.

Create the basic layout:

```bash
mkdir -p src/YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE tests tools
touch src/YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE/__init__.py
printf '3.12\n' > .python-version
```

Put importable runtime code under `src/YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE/`, tests under `tests/`, and repository-only maintenance code under `tools/`. Keep generated output out of all three.

## 2. Extend `.gitignore`

Append the outputs the project uses:

```gitignore
.coverage
.pytest_cache/
.ruff_cache/
.cache/
.pydocfmt_cache/
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
build/
dist/
htmlcov/
*.egg-info/
/.generated/
/site/
/zensical.generated.toml
```

The current `.cache/` entry is for ty's project-local cache. Once ty provides a supported cache-directory setting, configure and git-ignore a tool-specific location instead. Remove coverage, pydocformatter, ty, or documentation entries when those tools are not enabled. Keep a deliberately committed lock file and authored documentation configuration out of the git-ignore list.

Replace the agnostic guide's illustrative `.codex/config.toml` with this complete Python-project version:

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
plan_mode_reasoning_effort = "high"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
web_search = "live"

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
writable_roots = [
  "~/.cache/gh",
  "~/.cache/pip",
  "~/.cache/uv",
  "~/.local/share/uv",
]
```

This repeats the GitHub CLI, pip, and uv paths deliberately because a repository-level `writable_roots` list replaces the user- or system-level list instead of extending it. Add every other external path this repository needs to the same list.

## 3. Configure project metadata, dependencies, and builds

Create or merge these sections in `pyproject.toml` (example template):

```toml
[project]
name = "YOUR-DISTRIBUTION-NAME"
dynamic = ["version"]
authors = [{name = "YOUR NAME"}]
maintainers = [{name = "YOUR NAME"}]
description = "ONE-SENTENCE DESCRIPTION"
readme = "README.md"
license = "YOUR-SPDX-LICENSE"
license-files = ["LICENSE.md"]
requires-python = ">=3.12"
keywords = ["your", "search", "terms"]
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
    "Programming Language :: Python",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.14",
]
dependencies = []

[project.urls]
homepage = "https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY"
source = "https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY"
changelog = "https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md"
documentation = "https://YOUR-DOCUMENTATION-URL/"
issues = "https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPOSITORY/issues"

# Delete this table when the project installs no command.
[project.scripts]
YOUR-CLI = "YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE.cli:main"

[dependency-groups]
docs = [
    "la-dev-codex-plugins==0.5.1",
    "zensical==0.0.53",
]
test = [
    {include-group = "docs"},
    "la-dev-codex-plugins[pytest]==0.5.1",
    "pytest==9.1.1",
    "pytest-cov==7.1.0",
    "pytest-mock==3.15.1",
    "pytest-xdist==3.8.0",
]
dev = [
    {include-group = "test"},
    "pre-commit==4.6.2",
    "pydocformatter==1.2.0",
    "ruff==0.16.2",
    "twine==7.0.0",
    "ty==0.0.70",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling>=1.31.0"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE"]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]
exclude = [
    ".github/",
    ".codex/",
    ".agents/",
    "AGENTS.md",
]

[tool.hatch.version]
path = "src/YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE/_version.py"
```

Remove URLs, scripts, license fields, classifiers, and dependency groups that genuinely do not apply. The metadata specification does not require a keyword case; prefer lowercase search terms such as `python`, `docstrings`, and `static-analysis`, retaining canonical capitalization only when it materially identifies a proper name or acronym. Browse the [complete current PyPI classifier list](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) and copy only classifiers that apply, with their exact spelling. Add a classifier for every supported Python version, but use `requires-python`, not classifiers, to constrain installation compatibility. Runtime dependencies should use the lowest compatible bounds needed by downstream resolvers; direct documentation, test, and development tools should use exact pins for reproducible repository work.

Create the version source:

```python
"""Package version."""

__version__ = "0.1.0"
```

Export it from `src/YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE/__init__.py` if version access is part of the public API. Keep this file as the single version source and test that built metadata and CLI output agree with it.

Resolve and commit the environment:

```bash
uv lock
uv sync --locked --no-default-groups --group dev
uv lock --check
uv tree
```

Use `uv run` for project commands. After every dependency edit, run `uv lock` to regenerate `uv.lock`; never edit the lock file manually. Review and commit the resulting lock-file diff, resync with `uv sync --locked --no-default-groups --group dev`, and run the full checks. Add a repository test such as `tests/test_dependency_pins.py` that parses `pyproject.toml` and fails when a direct `docs`, `test`, or `dev` string is not an exact `name==version` pin; allow only `{include-group = "..."}` table entries.

## 4. Configure pytest

Start with the uncomplicated pytest configuration:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = ["-n", "auto"]
filterwarnings = ["error"]
testpaths = ["tests"]
```

Use module-level test functions, plain `assert`, fixtures, `pytest.raises`, `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, and `pytest-mock`. Use `uv run pytest -n 0 PATH` for focused serial debugging and `uv run pytest` for the configured parallel suite.

### Decide whether working-directory isolation is useful

Enable shared guarded-CWD mode when tests should not depend on the repository root but could accidentally do so. It is especially useful when code discovers `pyproject.toml` or other configuration by walking from the current directory, uses relative input/output paths, launches subprocesses that inherit the CWD, or writes through `tempfile` APIs. The guard makes accidental repository reads and writes fail early while redirecting ordinary temporary files to a safe writable location.

You can skip shared guarding when the suite intentionally tests against the checkout as its working directory, a framework requires repository-root execution, every relevant test already chooses an explicit temporary CWD, or a small pure-unit suite performs no relative filesystem access or configuration discovery. Skipping it means omitting the plugin settings and root `conftest.py` below; ordinary pytest remains fully supported. You may also load the plugin only for selected tests and use its private fixtures without guarding every unmarked test.

To enable shared guarding, extend the pytest table:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = ["-n", "auto"]
filterwarnings = ["error"]
testpaths = ["tests"]
la_dev_cwd_isolation_unmarked = "shared_guarded"
```

Create root `conftest.py`:

```python
"""Repository-wide pytest configuration."""

pytest_plugins = ("la_dev_codex_plugins.pytest_isolation.plugin",)
```

The default eager cleanup is the simplest choice. Use `la_dev_cwd_isolation_cleanup = "pytest_retained"` only when a cooperative resource keeps interpreter-owned files open until shutdown; that mode also needs pytest temporary-path retention configuration. See [Pytest working-directory isolation](https://github.com/pallgeuer/la-dev-codex-plugins/blob/main/docs/pytest_isolation.md) before enabling it.

For a test that deliberately needs a private writable CWD:

```python
def test_generates_file(isolated_cwd):
    output = isolated_cwd / "output.txt"
    output.write_text("result", encoding="utf-8")
```

Use `guarded_cwd` instead when a particular test must prove that it does not read from or write to its CWD.

## 5. Configure pydocformatter

The following is pydocformatter's complete self-configuration and is a strong, intentionally strict starting point:

```toml
[tool.pydocfmt]
line-length = 120
indent-style = "space"
indent-width = 4
line-ending = "lf"
respect-gitignore = true
force-exclude = true
extend-select = [
    "no-blank-line-after-function-docstring",
    "summary-trailing-period",
    "non-imperative-summary",
    "summary-starts-with-this",
    "missing-public-module-attribute-documentation",
    "attribute-documentation-order",
    "parameter-type-required",
    "return-type-required",
    "yield-type-required",
    "class-attribute-type-required",
    "module-attribute-type-required",
    "rule-codes-in-suppression-comments",
]
ignore = [
    "public-class-attribute-docstring-must-be-attached",
    "public-module-attribute-docstring-must-be-attached",
    "private-class-attribute-docstring-must-be-owner",
    "private-module-attribute-docstring-must-be-owner",
]
require-explicit = [
    "rule-codes-in-suppression-comments",
    "rule-names-in-suppression-comments",
]

[tool.pydocfmt.docstring]
convention = "google"
missing-documentation = "all-docstrings"
require-init-attribute-documentation = true

[tool.pydocfmt.comment]
detect-code = true
detect-expressions = true
join-standalone-lines = true
task-marker-mode = "hanging"

[tool.pydocfmt.per-file-ignores]
"tests/**/test_*.py" = ["PDF6"]

[tool.pydocfmt.per-file-settings]
"tests/**/test_*.py" = { docstring-missing-documentation = "has-section" }
```

Before adopting it:

- Set `convention` in `[tool.pydocfmt.docstring]` to the project's Google, NumPy, reStructuredText, or generic docstring convention.
- Choose `missing-documentation` in `[tool.pydocfmt.docstring]`. The example's `"all-docstrings"` value is a good fit for AI-oriented development, where consistently generating documentation for every eligible definition is inexpensive and gives later agents more local context, but it may impose too much writing and maintenance overhead on a primarily manual workflow. Separately decide whether `require-init-attribute-documentation = true` in the same table is appropriate for the project's attributes.
- Review `respect-gitignore` and `force-exclude` under `[tool.pydocfmt]`. With `force-exclude = true`, pydocformatter applies configured exclusions to explicitly passed paths, so do not repeat `--force-exclude` in commands that load this configuration.
- Review the type-requirement rules in `extend-select` under `[tool.pydocfmt]`, including `parameter-type-required`, `return-type-required`, `yield-type-required`, `class-attribute-type-required`, and `module-attribute-type-required`.
- Select one suppression-comment identity policy through the applicable rules in `extend-select` and `require-explicit` under `[tool.pydocfmt]`.
- Set `indent-style` and `indent-width` under `[tool.pydocfmt]`, and keep them consistent with Ruff and the existing source. The example uses four spaces.
- Decide whether `join-standalone-lines` in `[tool.pydocfmt.comment]` should combine adjacent ordinary prose comments into paragraphs before wrapping. Keep it enabled when manually wrapped comment lines should be reflowed as prose; disable it when adjacent comment lines must remain separate semantic lines.
- Confirm that `[tool.pydocfmt.per-file-ignores]` and `[tool.pydocfmt.per-file-settings]` fit the project's test style and paths.
- Remove a rule from `ignore` under `[tool.pydocfmt]` only after resolving its incompatibility with the chosen attachment policy.

Run:

```bash
uv run pydocfmt check --fix
uv run pydocfmt check
```

## 6. Configure Ruff

Copy and adapt this broad, opinionated Ruff starting point:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
force-exclude = true
indent-width = 4
line-length = 200
output-format = "grouped"
preview = true
respect-gitignore = true
src = ["src", "tools"]

[tool.ruff.analyze]
preview = true

[tool.ruff.format]

    "DOC",
    "any-type",
    "compare-to-empty-string",
    "doc-line-too-long",

[tool.ruff.lint.mccabe]
max-complexity = 50

[tool.ruff.lint.pep8-naming]
extend-ignore-names = ["[A-Z]", "[A-Z][A-Z]"]

[tool.ruff.lint.pycodestyle]
ignore-overlong-task-comments = true

[tool.ruff.lint.pylint]
allow-magic-value-types = ["str", "bytes", "int"]
max-args = 20
max-bool-expr = 20
max-branches = 30
max-locals = 50
max-nested-blocks = 15
max-positional-args = 6
max-public-methods = 80
max-returns = 30
max-statements = 300
max-statements-in-try = 25
```

Before adopting it:

- Set `src` under `[tool.ruff]` to every first-party source root, and replace `YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE` in `[tool.ruff.lint.isort].known-first-party` with the import package. Add other first-party packages only when they exist.
- Choose `line-length`, `indent-width`, and the `[tool.ruff.format]` values for indentation, line endings, and quotes, keeping shared settings consistent with pydocformatter. This example uses Ruff's `line-length = 200` for formatting but ignores `line-too-long`, so it does not enforce a universal 200-character ceiling.
- Decide whether `preview = true` under `[tool.ruff]`, `[tool.ruff.analyze]`, `[tool.ruff.format]`, and `[tool.ruff.lint]` is acceptable. Preview rules and formatter behavior can change between pinned Ruff releases; disable preview consistently if the project wants only stable behavior.
- Decide whether `boolean-positional-value-in-call` in `extend-select` matches the project's API style, and whether `future-annotations = true` matches its annotation and runtime-compatibility policy.
- Confirm the paths and rule-name exceptions in `[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]`. Allowing `assert` throughout tests is conventional for pytest; allowing `private-member-access` is a separate choice about white-box tests.
- Decide whether `[tool.ruff.format].docstring-code-format` should reformat Python examples in docstrings and whether `skip-magic-trailing-comma = true` matches the desired call and collection layout. Review the related trailing-comma ignores and `[tool.ruff.lint.isort].split-on-trailing-comma` together.
- Decide whether multiline implicit string concatenation and parent-relative imports are project conventions; adjust `[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-implicit-str-concat]`, `[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-tidy-imports]` accordingly.
- Review `[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-type-checking].exempt-modules` and `runtime-evaluated-decorators`. Add custom dataclass-like or framework decorators only when annotations beneath them are actually evaluated at runtime; remove exemptions the project does not need.
- Decide whether the `[tool.ruff.lint.isort]` sorting choices and `[tool.ruff.lint.isort.import-heading]` comments are desired. Import headings create persistent source comments and are not required for correct import grouping.
- Review `[tool.ruff.lint.pep8-naming].extend-ignore-names`; the example permits one- and two-letter uppercase names, which may be useful for type variables or mathematical notation but too broad for some projects. Add special naming patterns only for real conventions.
- Review `[tool.ruff.lint.pylint].allow-magic-value-types`; permitting all strings, bytes, and integers suppresses many magic-value findings and may be broader than the project wants.
- Treat `[tool.ruff.lint.mccabe].max-complexity` and the `[tool.ruff.lint.pylint]` limits as permissive migration values, not universal recommendations. Tighten them where they would flag genuinely hard-to-maintain code without forcing artificial decomposition.

Run:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format --check
```

## 7. Configure ty

Copy and possibly adapt the complete configuration:

```toml
[tool.ty.src]
respect-ignore-files = true
```

Run:

```bash
uv run ty check --force-exclude
```

The project `requires-python` declaration supplies the baseline Python environment; verify that source roots, generated files, optional imports, and framework-specific behavior are analyzed as intended. Add configuration only for real project requirements rather than preemptive ignores.

Ty currently provides `--force-exclude` only on the CLI, with no equivalent TOML setting. Ordinary discovery already honors `exclude` and ignore files, but explicitly passed targets override them; retaining the flag makes the command safe if targets are appended later. The recommended pre-commit hook sets `pass_filenames: false`, so its entry does not need the flag. When ty supports the setting in TOML, configure it there and remove the redundant CLI flag.

## 8. Add the Python `AGENTS.md` instructions

Add these sections to the root `AGENTS.md`. If a same-named section already exists from the agnostic setup, merge the listed lines into it instead of repeating the heading:

```markdown
## Commands

- Use uv for venv management and ALL Python execution.
- Never run uv with a custom/temporary cache dir (e.g. UV_CACHE_DIR or --cache-dir); if cache-related uv failures occur then abort and notify the user.
- The venv has no pip; use `uv pip`, `uv tree`, or similar.
- Use pytest for running tests. Pytest uses pytest-xdist multiprocessing by default; pass `-n 0` for serial debugging or focused runs where worker startup is slower.
- Use `uv run ty check` for type checking, `uv run ruff ...` for code formatting/linting, and `uv run pydocfmt check --fix` to format docstrings/comments.
- Use `uv run la-dev-markdown-tables` to fix Markdown table formatting and `uv run la-dev-markdown-tables --check` to verify it.

## Code style

- Do not import functions directly into the local namespace; import the containing module and call functions through it (for example, `from X import Y` followed by `Y.func()`, or `import X.Y` followed by `X.Y.func()`, or `import X.Y as Z` followed by `Z.func()`). Classes, exceptions, types, and constants may be imported directly. Direct function imports are allowed in `__init__.py` files (or other clearly sole-purpose public API files) solely to re-export functions as part of the package's public API.
- Write concise, meaningful docstrings. Module docstrings should identify what the file/package is, not say that it "provides support" or "implements" something. Attribute documentation must explain the role, semantics, units, source, or downstream use of the attribute; never restate the identifier with filler like "The foo value" or "The FOO enum member."

## Tests

- Write tests as module-level pytest functions. Use plain `assert`, `pytest.raises`, fixtures, `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, and `pytest-mock`; do not add `unittest.TestCase` test classes.

## Workflows

- When changing function signatures or class attributes, update all affected docstrings in the same change.

## Packaging

- Keep wheel contents limited to installed runtime code, runtime data, licenses, and required metadata. Include in the source distribution the source, build metadata, license and user-documentation files, and tests and configuration needed to build, document, and validate the unpacked archive. Exclude CI and agent configuration, repository-only helpers, and local state unless a non-sensitive file is required by those checks; never package credentials or secrets.
```

## 9. Complete pre-commit

Append this local repository to the `repos` list created by the agnostic guide:

```yaml
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ruff-check-fix
        name: ruff check (fix)
        entry: uv run ruff check --fix
        language: system
        types_or: [python, pyi]
        stages: [pre-commit]

      - id: pydocfmt-fix
        name: pydocfmt (fix)
        entry: uv run pydocfmt check --fix
        language: system
        types: [python]
        stages: [pre-commit]

      - id: ruff-format-fix
        name: ruff format (fix)
        entry: uv run ruff format
        language: system
        types_or: [python, pyi]
        stages: [pre-commit]

      - id: ruff-check
        name: ruff check
        entry: uv run ruff check
        language: system
        types_or: [python, pyi]
        stages: [pre-push, manual]

      - id: pydocfmt-check
        name: pydocfmt (check)
        entry: uv run pydocfmt check
        language: system
        types: [python]
        stages: [pre-push, manual]

      - id: ruff-format-check
        name: ruff format (check)
        entry: uv run ruff format --check
        language: system
        types_or: [python, pyi]
        stages: [pre-push, manual]

      - id: ty
        name: ty
        entry: uv run ty check
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        stages: [pre-commit, pre-push, manual]

      - id: pytest
        name: pytest
        entry: uv run pytest
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        stages: [pre-commit, pre-push, manual]
```

The hooks are declared in nominal execution order. Commit-time hooks apply Ruff lint fixes, pydocformatter fixes, and then final Ruff formatting before running ty and pytest. Pre-push/manual runs the corresponding non-mutating checks in the same order before ty and pytest.

Keep the ty hook as bare `uv run ty check`: `pass_filenames: false` prevents pre-commit from appending explicit paths, so normal ty discovery honors configured exclusions and ignore files without `--force-exclude`. Add the flag only if the hook later names or receives explicit targets that must still be excluded.

The pytest hook also sets `pass_filenames: false` because pytest should select the suite through its configuration rather than receive changed source paths. With the [recommended pytest configuration](#4-configure-pytest), `uv run pytest` runs the configured pytest-xdist multiprocessing suite; use `uv run pytest -n 0` for serial debugging, focused runs where worker startup dominates, or tests that are not yet safe to distribute. Omit pytest-xdist and the `addopts` entry when the suite is too small to benefit or relies on process-global or external resources that cannot be isolated across workers.

The agnostic setup already supplies Markdown-table fix/check hooks. Commit-time hooks may mutate files; the manual stage used by CI is non-mutating. Run the complete suite until it passes without changing files:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual
```

## 10. Add Python CI

For any CI provider, create the locked environment and run the manual pre-commit stage:

```bash
uv sync --locked --no-default-groups --group dev
uv run --no-sync pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual --show-diff-on-failure
```

Test the minimum and newest supported Python versions. Add operating-system, architecture, alternative-interpreter, or libc jobs only when the project claims that support or has a realistic compatibility risk. Do not infer support merely because one job passes on `ubuntu-latest`.

### If the project uses a GitHub remote

Replace the generic workflow's installation and check steps with:

```yaml
      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v8.3.2
        with:
          enable-cache: true
      - name: Sync locked development environment
        run: uv sync --locked --no-default-groups --group dev
      - name: Run non-mutating checks
        run: uv run --no-sync pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual --show-diff-on-failure
```

## 11. Prepare package-index documentation

For a package published to PyPI, prefer a dedicated `PYPI.md` when the GitHub README contains repository-only installation paths, relative links, plugin instructions, contributor material, or other content that renders poorly on a package index. Use `README.md` directly when the same file is correct in both locations.

A concise `PYPI.md` should contain:

```markdown
# Distribution name

One package-oriented description.

## Install

The exact `pip`, `uv`, or tool installation command.

## Quick start

One installed-package example.

## Documentation

Absolute links to full documentation, source, changelog, and issues.

## Compatibility

Supported Python versions and platforms.
```

When using it, change project metadata to:

```toml
[project]
readme = "PYPI.md"
```

Build and inspect both distributions before release:

```bash
uv build --clear
uv run twine check dist/*
uv run python -m zipfile -l dist/*.whl
uv run python -m tarfile -l dist/*.tar.gz
```

Smoke-test the wheel and sdist independently in isolated environments. Verify package version, imports, installed data, entry points, and one representative operation; tests running from the checkout do not prove the distributions are complete.

## 12. Publish to PyPI through GitHub trusted publishing

Skip this section when the project does not publish to PyPI or does not use a GitHub remote. Otherwise configure a PyPI trusted publisher for the repository and workflow, then create a GitHub environment named `pypi` with a required reviewer. That reviewer is the visible human approval between a validated release and irreversible package publication.

Create `.github/workflows/python-package-release.yml` and replace the placeholders:

```yaml
name: Python package release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      ref:
        description: Git ref to build and validate without publishing
        required: true
        default: main
        type: string
  release:
    types: [published]

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

          test "$(git cat-file -t "$tag")" = tag
          test "$(git rev-list -n 1 "$tag")" = "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
          version="$(uv run --no-sync python -c 'from YOUR_IMPORT_PACKAGE import __version__; print(__version__)')"
          test "v$version" = "$tag"
      - name: Build and check distributions
        run: |
          uv build --clear
          uv run --no-sync twine check dist/*

          mv dist/*.whl dist/*.tar.gz release/packages/
          uv run --no-sync la-dev-release-checksums --output release/SHA256SUMS release/packages/*.whl release/packages/*.tar.gz

        run: gh release upload "${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}" release/packages/*.whl release/packages/*.tar.gz release/SHA256SUMS --repo "${{ github.repository }}"
```

Replace CLI smoke checks with installed-import checks when the package has no CLI. Preserve artifact order when generating checksums. The manual `workflow_dispatch` path builds and tests but cannot enter either publishing job. For stronger supply-chain control, pin third-party actions to reviewed commit SHAs and let Dependabot propose updates.

The checksum manifest is recommended for released Python artifacts. Generate it only after metadata, installation, and smoke validation, publish it beside the exact wheel and source archive, and never restore an older manifest after a failed generation. See [Release checksum manifests](https://github.com/pallgeuer/la-dev-codex-plugins/blob/main/docs/release_checksums.md).

## 13. Extend `RELEASE.md` for Python and PyPI

In the generic runbook from the agnostic setup, make these Python steps exact:

1. Name the package version file, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `PYPI.md` or `README.md`, wheel name, source-archive name, tag form, PyPI project, and release workflow as sources of truth.
2. Have Codex inspect the complete diff since the previous tag and propose the next semantic version. Stop and obtain explicit user approval of that exact version before editing it.
3. Update the version source, changelog comparison links/date, classifiers, Python support text, package-index description, entry-point examples, and lock file when affected.
4. Run `uv lock --check`, the full manual pre-commit stage, documentation checks, `uv build --clear`, `twine check`, archive-content inspection, and independent wheel/sdist smoke tests.
5. Commit and push the release preparation, require CI success for that commit, create an annotated tag on it, and run the workflow's nonpublishing `workflow_dispatch` preflight against the tag.
6. Summarize the exact version, tag, commit, artifacts, GitHub Release, and PyPI trusted-publishing pipeline. Stop for a second explicit user approval before publishing the GitHub Release.
7. After the release event starts the workflow, show the exact pending `pypi` environment deployment, ask the user to approve it on GitHub, and end the turn. Do not poll while waiting for that manual action.
8. Resume only after new user input. Require the workflow to succeed, then verify GitHub assets, `SHA256SUMS`, PyPI files/metadata/provenance, and a fresh installation of the exact published version.
9. Never move a pushed tag or replace a PyPI filename. Retain exact validated artifacts after partial publication; a defective published artifact requires a new version.

For a non-GitHub project or an explicitly chosen direct-release process, keep the same two user confirmations and artifact validation. Publish the exact checked files with `uv publish dist/*.whl dist/*.tar.gz` or `twine upload`, retain credentials outside shell history, upload the artifacts and generated `SHA256SUMS` to the release destination, and perform the same public verification.

## 14. Verify the Python setup

Run the checks in increasing scope:

```bash
uv lock --check
uv run ruff check
uv run pydocfmt check
uv run ruff format --check
uv run ty check --force-exclude
uv run pytest -n 0
uv run pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual
git diff --check
git status --short
```

For a published package, also build, inspect, and smoke-test both distributions. Format Markdown tables with `uv run la-dev-markdown-tables` and verify with `uv run la-dev-markdown-tables --check`.

Run the Python audit; it checks both this recipe and the prerequisite agnostic recipe:

```text
$toolkit:perform audit-project-setup[python]
```
